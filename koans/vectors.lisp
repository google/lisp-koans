;;; Vectors are one-dimensional arrays. This means that general array operations
;;; will work on vectors normally. However, Lisp also defines some functions for
;;; operating on sequences - which means, either vectors or lists.

  ;; #(...) is syntax sugar for defining literal vectors.
  (let ((vector #(1 11 111)))

(define-test length
  ;; The function LENGTH works both for vectors and for lists.
  (assert-equal ____ (length '(1 2 3)))
  (assert-equal ____ (length #(1 2 3))))

(define-test bit-vector
  ;; #*0011 defines a bit vector literal with four elements: 0, 0, 1 and 1.
