;;; Lisp structures encapsulate data which belongs together. They are a template
;;; of sorts, providing a way to generate multiple instances of uniformly
;;; organized information
;;; Defining a structure also interns accessor functions to get and set the
;;; slots of that structure.

;;; The following form creates a new structure class named BASKETBALL-PLAYER
;;; with slots named NAME, TEAM, and NUMBER.
;;; This additionally creates functions MAKE-BASKETBALL-PLAYER,
;;; COPY-BASKETBALL-PLAYER, BASKETBALL-PLAYER-P, BASKETBALL-PLAYER-NAME,
;;; BASKETBALL-PLAYER-TEAM, and BASKETBALL-PLAYER-NUMBER.
