description: "Common Lisp Koans is a language learning exercise in the same vein as the ruby koans, python koans and others. It is a port of the prior koans with some modifications to highlight lisp-specific features. Structured as ordered groups of broken unit tests, the project guides the learner progressively through many Common Lisp language features."
