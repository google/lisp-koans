Getting Started
---------------

From a terminal, execute your lisp interpreter on the file 'contemplate.lsp' e.g.

    sbcl --script contemplate.lsp

Running on a fresh version should output the following:

```
Thinking about ASSERTS
    ASSERT-TRUE has damaged your karma.

You have not yet reached enlightenment ...
  A koan is incomplete.

Please meditate on the following code:
   File "koans/asserts.lsp"
   Koan "ASSERT-TRUE"
   Current koan assert status is "(INCOMPLETE)"

You are now 0/169 koans and 0/25 lessons away from reaching enlightenment
```

This indicates that the script has completed, and that the learner should look
to asserts.lsp to locate and fix the problem.  The problem will be within 
a define-test block such as

    (define-test assert-true
        "t is true.  Replace the blank with a t"
        (assert-true ___))

In this case, the test is incomplete, and the student should fill 
in the blank (____) with appropriate lisp code to make the assert pass.


In order to test code, or evaluate tests interactively, students may copy
and paste code into the lisp command line REPL.

Quoting the Ruby Koans instructions::
-------------------------------------

   "In test-driven development the mantra has always been, red, green, 
refactor. Write a failing test and run it (red), make the test pass (green),
then refactor it (that is look at the code and see if you can make it any
better. In this case you will need to run the koan and see it fail (red), make
the test pass (green), then take a moment and reflect upon the test to see what
it is teaching you and improve the code to better communicate its
intent (refactor)."

Content
-------

The Common Lisp koans are based on the python koans and ruby koans projects.
Additionally, many of the tests are based on new material that is special
to Common Lisp.

Note that the unit on threads uses an SBCL specific threading API.
